    <p>Prievidza (Slovak pronunciation: [ˈprɪeʋidza] ; Hungarian: Privigye, German: Priwitz) is a city in the central-western Slovakia. With approximately 46,000 inhabitants it is the second biggest municipality in the Trenčín Region and 11th largest city in Slovakia generally. </p>
    <p>The name is probably derived from a personal name Previd with possessive suffix -ja, signifying 'Previd's village'. An alternative and less probable derivation is from the word element, vid- (as in vidieť, 'to see'), so, previdieť, 'to see through', thus 'the village which can be seen from all directions', or 'the village in the thin stand'.</p>
    <p>As a central city of Prievidza District and Upper Nitra region (in Slovak: Horná Nitra), Prievidza is a seat for many institutions of regional importance – governmental as well as commercial.

        Because of its relatively high percentage of planted trees, Prievidza is commonly called the "green city".
        
        Prievidza has six boroughs: Staré mesto (meaning 'Old Town'), Píly, Necpaly, Kopanice, Zápotôčky and Žabník. Three adjoining villages are an administrative part of Prievidza: Hradec, Malá Lehôtka and Veľká Lehôtka. </p>
